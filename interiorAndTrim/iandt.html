        <p>
        Similarly to how the sheet metal has minute differences between fifth generation years, the interiors have personalities as well. While some parts were a direct share beetween the 61-62 years, I have elected to go with the 63-64 bucket seats. The 61-62 stock versions shared a bench seat for the front. </p>
        <!--Indoor vs outdoor differences-->
        <p>The Bel Air originally had a bench seat.</p>
        <!--find speaker grill pictures to show change
            use internet pictures to show stock-->

        <p>In the rear of the car the speaker grill is different between the years. This is a 62-64 year model. The 61 version is increadibly rare. </p>

        <!--Derermine what year the shape changed to circular
            take picture of antenna's-->
        <p>The antenna bears a tear drop shape for the '61. </p>
        
        <!--get radio options for here, dash fashia for SS version-->

        <!--show transformation of trim
            explain differences of insignia for the different years that share '61 status-->

        <!--bumper guards, grill guard, explain 2v3 peiece bumpers california-->

        <!--pedal plates-->
