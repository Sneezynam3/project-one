        <p>Chevrolet produced seven generations of the Bel Air. The full size veichle was made in the U.S. from 1950 to 1975. The fifth generation ran from 1961-1964. Although the generation was considered the same through that time period, the design featured contrasting sheetmetal between the years.</p>
