            This car was purchased by my father 12-27-2009, along with a donor car. The donor car was also a 1961, but a Biscayne. From there the cars were placed along side each other in a backyard. Due to the ill repair of the two, cutting, welding, and fabricating was required to combine them into one. After sitting outside for years, the veichle became rusty complicating a full restoration. Little holes will show through a paint job and quickly become very cancerous.
