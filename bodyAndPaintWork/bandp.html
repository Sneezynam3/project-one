            This car was purchased by my father 12-27-2009, along with a donor car. The donor car was also a 1961, but a Biscayne. From there the cars were placed along side each other in a backyard. Due to the ill repair of the two, cutting, welding, and fabricating was required to combine them into one. After sitting outside for years, the veichle became rusty complicating a full restoration. Little holes will show through a paint job and quickly become very cancerous. 
        <br> <br>
            The restoration process starts by removing all material from the metal. The shiny metal is then vulnerable to rusting but also can't hide any flaws. From there heat shrinking and expanding is required in order to use as little filler as possible. In this cars case the filler is all metal(polyester resen with alumin dust which uses fiber glass hardner). Then comes the glaze that appears green in the photos. The car is then ready for primer, which is then block sanded and primed again.

        <p>The deck lid aka the trunk had multiple holes in the tail light housings. With the radious of the sheet metal, a simple patch became overly complicated. The easiest solution was to use the donor cars deck lid and cut the nessesary metal away for the patches. </p>

<p>The attention to detail on this car is astounding. With the countless hours put into the body work, no rust spots will be overlooked. Each and every curve matches the other side making the car a symetrical. All the panal gaps have been meticulously set for uniformity. </p>
