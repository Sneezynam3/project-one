            This car was purchased by my father 12-27-2009, along with a donor car. The donor car was also a 1961, but a Biscayne. From there the cars were placed along side each other in a backyard. Due to the ill repair of the two, cutting, welding, and fabricating was required to combine them into one. After sitting outside for years, the veichle became rusty complicating a full restoration. Little holes will show through a paint job and quickly become very cancerous. 
        <br> <br>
            The restoration process starts by removing all material from the metal. The shiny metal is then vulnerable to rusting but also can't hide any flaws. From there heat shrinking and expanding is required in order to use as little filler as possible. In this cars case the filler is all metal(polyester resen with alumin dust which uses fiber glass hardner). Then comes the glaze that appears green in the photos. The car is then ready for primer, which is then block sanded and primed again.

    <p>One particularly bad area of rust on old cars is the quarter panels. Both sides on this car needed some serious attention. Some old school tips are shown below... </p>

    <p>The driver side front fender had serious rust where the fender attached to the car. Again near the wheel well. The passenger side fender is from the Biscayne and had to have an antenna hole plugged but was in better shape.</p>
