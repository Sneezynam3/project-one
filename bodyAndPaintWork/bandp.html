    <p>The car was purchased by my father 12-27-2009. Along with a donor car. The donor car was also a 1961, but a Biscayne. The Biscayne is the cheaper trim model of the Bel Air. From there the cars were placed along side each other in a backyard. Due to the ill repair of the two, cutting, welding, and fabricating was required to combine them into one.
