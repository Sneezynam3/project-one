    <p>Chevrolet produced seven generations of the Bel Air. The full size veichle was made in the U.S. from 1950 to 1975. The fifth generation ran from 1961-1964. Although the generation was considered the same through that time period, the designs featured contrasting sheetmetal between the years.

    <p>This is my Bel Air. There are others like it. Some better. Some worse. But this one is mine. Here is the story of my Bel Air. 
    </p>

    <p>The car was purchased by my father 12-27-2009. Along with a donor car. The donor car was also a 1961, but a Biscayne. The Biscayne is the cheaper trim model of the Bel Air. From there the cars were placed along side each other in a backyard. Due to the ill repair of the two, cutting, welding, and fabricating was required to combine them into one.

    <p>My father unfortunately passed away 7-2-2017. I have taken on the project and have further refined the idea of this beautifly crafted automobile. Here is the car after sitting about a year in my garage.
